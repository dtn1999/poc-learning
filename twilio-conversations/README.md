# Twilio Conversation API

Twilio conversations is an omnichannel messaging platform that allows to build engaging conversational messaging experiences
across many channels. The conversation API is built around three main concepts: *Conversation*, *Participant*, and *Message*.

## Conversation

A conversation is an object that contains a message thread between two or more participants. A conversation's participant
can either be a human or a bot. Each time a message is sent by a participant, it is added to the conversation and relayed to
all other participants in the conversation.

The picture above shows a high level overview of the conversation API. The picture shows the connection between communication
channels and conversations. Twilio supports internal and external channels. On the one hand, internal channels are Twilio's own channels such
as the `Conversations SDK`. On the other hand, external channels are third party channels like SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc.

Each time a message is sent by a participant, it is routed to a real-world endpoint like an application that uses the
conversations SDK, a mobile phone's SMS application, or a user's inbox on Facebook Messenger.

Users connected via the Conversations SDK will be uniquely identified by their `identity`, which is generated by the application
integrating the conversations SDK.

For external channels, the external address is mapped to a `Twilio-controlled address`. The pair of addresses (external and Twilio-controlled)
uniquely identifies a non-chat participant in conversations, and the proxy address acts as the external user's window into the conversation.
